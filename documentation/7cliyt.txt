Note that you will need to have ytfzf, youtube-dl, and mpv installed on your system to use this script.

This looks like a Bash script that uses ytfzf, youtube-dl, and mpv to search for and stream/download videos from YouTube.

When executed, the script will prompt the user for search terms if none are provided, then prompt the user to choose between streaming or downloading the selected video.

If the user chooses to download the video, they will be prompted to select a video quality before the download starts. The downloaded video will be saved to the current directory with the video's title and file extension as the filename.

If the user chooses to stream the video, they will be prompted to select a video quality before the stream starts.

It's important to note that this script relies on ytfzf, youtube-dl, and mpv being properly installed and configured on the system.
